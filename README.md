# C++ Level 2 Course - Homework and Solutions

This repository contains all of my solutions for the exercises and homework assignments from the **Course 6: C++ المستوى الثاني (C++ Level 2)**.

It serves as a portfolio to document my progress and understanding of the intermediate and advanced C++ concepts covered throughout this course.

## 📚 Topics & Concepts Covered

The exercises in this course cover a wide range of essential C++ topics, including:

### 1. Debugging and Memory
* **Debugging**: Strategies for finding and fixing logical and runtime errors.
* **Breakpoints**: Using breakpoints to inspect the program's state.
* **Memory Inspection**: Analyzing variable values in memory (`Autos` and `Quick Watch` windows).

### 2. Pointers and Memory Management
* **References (`&`)**: Using references for parameter passing (`Call By Reference`).
* **Pointers (`*`)**: Declaring, dereferencing, and manipulating pointers.
* **Dynamic Allocation**: Using `new` and `delete` for manual memory management.
* **Stack vs. Heap**: Understanding the two main program memory areas.

### 3. Data Structures (Vectors)
* **`std::vector` Introduction**: Advantages over C-style arrays.
* **Manipulation**: Adding (`push_back`), removing (`pop_back`, `clear`), and accessing elements (`.at()`, `[]`).
* **Iterators**: Looping through vectors using iterators.
* **Ranged-based `for` Loops**: Modern syntax for iterating over collections.

### 4. Functions and Modularity
* **Function Overloading**: Creating multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
* **Recursion**: Functions that call themselves.
* **Custom Libraries**: Creating header files (`.h`) to organize code.
* **Call Stack**: Understanding the function call mechanism.

### 5. File Management (File I/O)
* **File Streams (`fstream`)**: Reading from and writing to external files.
* **File Modes**:
    * **Write (`ios::out`)**: Overwriting a file's content.
    * **Append (`ios::app`)**: Adding content to the end of a file.
    * **Read (`ios::in`)**: Reading content from a file.
* **Data Handling**: Loading data from a file into a vector and saving a vector back to a file.

### 6. Other C++ Concepts
* **Ternary Operator**: Concise syntax for `if-else` statements.
* **Time Library (`<ctime>`)**: Getting and formatting local and UTC time.
* **String Manipulation (`<string>`)**: Common methods like `.length()`, `.find()`, `.substr()`, etc.
* **Exception Handling (`try...catch`)**: Catching runtime errors to prevent program crashes.
